CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
Build Stage: The Docker image is built from the source code using the Dockerfile.

Test Stage: Automated tests are run to validate the functionality of the application.

Deploy to Dev: The Docker image is deployed to the development environment for testing.

Manual Approval: Manual approval is required before deploying to the production environment.

Deploy to Prod: Upon approval, the Docker image is deployed to the production environment.
